# Using Convolutional Neural Nets to model water contamination #

### What is this repository for? ###

This code is for using a CNN to solve the governing equations for contaminant transport in porous media.
The neural net is trained to solve the pressure equation for a given geological scenario. The key idea used in this
work was to use physical constraint (e.g. divergence free velocity field) in the loss function definition.
